Stubs for Sphinx doles and directives
=====================================

When using plain docutils, the roles and directives added by Sphinx are not
available. This can sometimes be a problem. This package aims to provide
very simple stubs that produce something "enough like" the expected results.

The initial aim is to make it easier to perform checks using Vale on documents
created with Sphinx.

Docutils itself is licensed under a Public Doman license.
Unfortunately, that is an option I have in any of the countries in the UK, so
this package is released under and MIT license.
